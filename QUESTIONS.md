ACL Questions

1. You've indicated an issue w/ the patients knee. What was the mechanism of injury?
	Sports *
	Fall from height
	Auto accident
	Impact Injury
	Unknown
	
2. You've indicated that the mechanism of injury was sports related. How did they injury it during sports?
	Body Contact 
	Equipment Contact
	Plant Foot and Twist *
	Explosive/Dynamic Movement Involving Knee Extension (eg: Jump)
	Explosive/Dynamic Movement Involving Knee Flexion (eg: Squat)
	Lateral Movement
	Fall
	Unknown
	
3. Plant foot and twist injuries often involve injury to the ligament or meniscus of the knee. Let's investigate further with that in mind. Can the patient walk unassisted?
	Yes
	No *

Be advised, the differential diagnosis of this type of injury includes knee dislocations, meniscal injuries, collateral ligaments injury, and posterolateral corner injuries to the knee. Other problems that have to be considered are: patellar dislocation or fracture. Femoral, tibial or fibular fracture.
The differential diagnosis of an acute hemarthrosis of the knee due to ACL in addition to a major ligamentous tear would include meniscal tear or patellar dislocation or osteochondral fracture.
	
4. So the patient can't walk unassisted and our mechanism of injury was plant/twist. Let's test the patient's knee range of motion (ROM). Normal knee flexion is ~142deg. Normal knee extension is ~1.6deg.
	ROM is normal
	ROM is > than normal
	ROM is < than normal *
	Unable to perform
	
	
5. Knee ROM being less than normal is typical of most knee injuries. Was their any popping, clicking, or other abnormal sounds? Popping or clicking could indicate injury to the menisucs. 
	Popping
	Clicking
	Other *
	None
	Unable to perform

6. Since the sound we heard was inconclusive, let's do some manual tests, starting with McMurrys. This will help determin if our injury is to the medial or lateral meniscus.
	Test was positive
	Test was negative *
	Unable to perform
	
6. A negative McMurry's test means our injury is unlikely to be meniscal in origin (though we can not rule it out entierly). Let's perform Lachman's test to see if there is involvement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). 
	Test was positive *
	Test was negative
	Unable to perform

7. A positive Lachman's test has a fairly high indication of an ACL tear. As our MOI was a plant and twist injury, the patient is unable to walk unassisted, knee flexion is less than normal, a sound was heard (though inconclusive), and we got a positive Lachman's test, most signs point to an ACL tear. 

Final confirmation should be done via imaging. Please send the patient to get this done asap. Make sure the patient knows to schedule a follow up with you in about a week to go over their imaging results. Until that time, have them follow RICE procedures (Rest Ice Compression Elevation)
	



Tennis Elbow Questions

1. You've indicated an issue w/ the patients elbow. What was the mechanism of injury?
	Sports *
	Fall from height
	Auto accident
	Impact Injury
	Unknown 
	
2. You've indicated that the mechanism of injury was sports related. How did they injury it during sports?
	Body Contact 
	Equipment Contact
	Fall On an Outstretched Hand
	Explosive/Dynamic Movement Involving Elbow Extension (eg: tricep press) *
	Explosive/Dynamic Movement Involving Elbow Flexion (eg: dumbell curl)
	Overhead Throw
	Unknown
	
3. Explosive/Dynamic movement involving elbow extension during sports often involves the ligaments or muscles. Let's investigate further with that in mind. Is the patient bracing their elbow, trying to hold it in place?
	Yes
	No *

Be advised, the differential diagnosis of this type of injury includes Radial Tunnel Syndrome, Posterior Interosseus Syndrome, Elbow Osteoarthritis, Fractures, Cervical Radiculopathy, and others. Care should be taken to ensure the following questions are investigated in depth.
	
4. Can the patient do elbow flexion/extension unassisted?
	Yes *
	No
	Unable to Perform
	
5. Test the patient's grip strength to eliminate possible patholgies masking our real issue. Was grip strength normal?
	Yes 
	No *
	Unable to Perform
	
5. Since the patient is not holding their elbow, nor do they have problems with elbow flexion/extension, but grip strength is not normal, it is unlikely that they have broken any bones. Did the patient report pain in either movement?
	Yes *
	No

6. Was there pain with elbow flexion or elbow extension?
	Elbow Flexion
	Elbow Extension *
    Both
	
7. Does the pain radiate distally or proximally to the elbow joint?
	Yes, radiation occurs distally *
	Yes, radiation occurs at joint
	No radiating pain present
	
8. Pain in elbow extension that radiates distally from the involved joint, while taking into account the answers to previous questions, sounds like the patient may have an overuse injury to the elbow extensors. Let's test the patient's elbow extension further. 

Mill's Test is designed to maximally stretch, and therefore provoke the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis. The test is positive if the patient reports sudden pain at the lateral epicondyle.  Perform Mill's test. 

	Mill's Test Positive *
	Mill's Test Negative
	Unable to Perform
	
9. A positive Mill's test indicates lateral epicondylitis. Let's continue our tests by performing Cozen's test. Much like Mill's Test, Cozen's test is designed to maximally flex, and thus provoke, the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis. The test is positive if the patient reports sudden pain at the lateral epicondyle.

	Cozen's Test Positive *
	Cozen's Test Negative
	Unable to Perform
	
10. All signs point to the patient experiencing lateral epicondylitis, or "tennis elbow" as it is colloquially known. Advise the patient to follow RICE procedures, and schedule further appointments with a physical therapist. If pain is debilitating for the patient, advise them on possible steroid injections and/or bracing. 

Ankle Inversion Spring

1. You've indicated an issue w/ the patients ankle. What was the mechanism of injury?
	Sports *
	Fall from height
	Auto accident
	Impact Injury
	Unknown
	
2. You've indicated that the mechanism of injury was sports related. How did they injury it during sports?
	Body Contact 
	Equipment Contact
	Plant Foot and Twist 
	Explosive/Dynamic Movement Involving Ankle Plantarflexion/Dorsiflexion (eg: Jump)
	Lateral Movement Involving Ankle Inversion/Eversion *
	Fall
	Unknown

3. Can the patient walk unassisted?
    Yes
    No *
    Unknown

4. Can the patient put any weight on the ankle at all?
    Yes *
    No
    Unable to Perform

Be advised that misdiagnosis is very common in this type of injury. Differential diagnosis that you should also be aware of are Impingement, Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome, Sinus Tarsi Syndrome, Cartilage or psteochondral injuries, Peroneal Tendinopathy or subluxation, and Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction. Further examination may be required if no imporvement is made after the first couple of days following initial examination.

5. An ankle injury involving lateral movement in which they are unable to stand unassisted, but are able to bare some weight on it is unlikely to be broken. However, it could involve a strain or sprain to the musculature or ligaments. Testing the patient's range of motion will help us figure that out. Test the patient's ankle inversion and eversion ROM, noting any pain elicited. 
    Normal Inversion/Eversion ROM
    Abnormal Inversion/Eversion ROM *
    Unable to Perform

6. Subdermal hematoma present?
    Lateral Foot *
    Medial Foot
    Anterior Foot
    Posterior Foot
    None

7. Abnormal inversion/eversion ROM, in addition to subdermal hematoma presenting in the lateral foot, sounds like classic signs of an inversion sprain. We should investigate the patient for injury to the anterior/posterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament to be sure. Perform the Talar Tilt Test. A positive test will elicit pain during test or if you feel a gap in the joint as compared to the non-involved limb. 
    Talar Tilt Test Positive *
    Talar Tilt Test Negative
    Unable to Perform

8. A positive talar tilt test, in addition to the previously gathered data, seems to confirm our diagnosis of an inversion ankle sprain with involvement of the anterior talofibular ligaments. In some cases, imaging may be required to confirm diagnosis. Advise patient on RICE procedures and send them for a physical therapy consultation.

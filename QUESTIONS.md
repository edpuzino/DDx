1. You've indicated an issue w/ the patients knee. What was the mechanism of injury?
	Sports *
	Fall from height
	Auto accident
	Impact Injury
	Unknown
	
2. You've indicated that the mechanism of injury was sports related. How did they injury it during sports?
	Body Contact 
	Equipment Contact
	Plant Foot and Twist *
	Explosive/Dynamic Movement Involving Knee Extension (eg: Jump)
	Explosive/Dynamic Movement Involving Knee Flexion (eg: Squat)
	Lateral Movement
	Fall
	Unknown
	
3. Plant foot and twist injuries often involve injury to the ligament or meniscus of the knee. Let's investigate further with that in mind. Can the patient walk unassisted?
	Yes
	No *
	
4. So the patient can't walk unassisted and our mechanism of injury was plant/twist. Let's test the patient's knee range of motion (ROM). Normal knee flexion is ~142deg. Normal knee extension is ~1.6deg.
	ROM is normal
	ROM is > than normal
	ROM is < than normal *
	Unable to perform
	
	
5. Knee ROM being less than normal is typical of most knee injuries. Was their any popping, clicking, or other abnormal sounds? Popping or clicking could indicate injury to the menisucs. 
	Popping
	Clicking
	Other *
	None
	Unable to perform

6. Since the sound we heard was inconclusive, let's do some manual tests, starting with McMurrys. This will help determin if our injury is to the medial or lateral meniscus.
	Test was positive
	Test was negative *
	Unable to perform
	
6. A negative McMurry's test means our injury is unlikely to be meniscal in origin (though we can not rule it out entierly). Let's perform Lachman's test to see if there is involvement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). 
	Test was positive *
	Test was negative
	Unable to perform

7. A positive Lachman's test has a fairly high indication of an ACL tear. As our MOI was a plant and twist injury, the patient is unable to walk unassisted, knee flexion is less than normal, a sound was heard (though inconclusive), and we got a positive Lachman's test, most signs point to an ACL tear. 

Final confirmation should be done via imaging. Please send the patient to get this done asap. Make sure the patient knows to schedule a follow up with you in about a week to go over their imaging results. Until that time, have them follow RICE procedures (Rest Ice Compression Elevation)
